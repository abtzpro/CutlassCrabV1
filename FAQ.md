## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Servo motors not responding

- **Solution:** Check the wiring and connections to the control unit. Ensure the servo motors are compatible with the specifications.

### Issue: Gecko Pad not adhering properly

### Issue: Parachute not deploying

- **Solution:** Check the spring-loaded mechanism and manual/remote trigger. Refer to the assembly guide for correct installation.

### Issue: GPS module not functioning

- **Solution:** Verify the GPS module's connections and settings. Consult the manufacturer's documentation if needed.

### Issue: Inflatable cushion not inflating

- **Solution:** Inspect the CO2 cartridge, pressure regulator, and release valve for proper attachment and functionality.
